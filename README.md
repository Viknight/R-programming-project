# R-programming-project
A project on analysis of global terrorism attacks that took place between 1975-2018.

Terrorism attack analysis is a process of extracting the visualizations of the affected places in the world due to various terrorist attacks by different terrorist organizations. This will help classify the data as well as assist us better understand these events with the help of patterns created by the visualizations. This can be useful in understanding the goals of such organizations and will also help us prepare to take better actions against them well before they even plan on doing such attack on any country, organization, places, etc. This can also be helpful in taking precautionary measures to reduce such activities in the future and also discourage and stop people from becoming part of such groups or organizations.

Global terrorism attacks analysis plays an important role in todayâ€™s world as such types of events are on the rise. People of different caste, creed, religion are getting attracted too such organizations who are willing to brain wash their targets. This global terrorism attacks analysis covers terrorism attacks from all over the world. This analysis will help the government and intelligence agencies identify such events well before they take place. R studio helps us to make this process simpler with-it flexibility and supporting packages. Visualising the output is also possible in R-Studio.

The compressed rar file consists of the dataset GDS of the global terrorist attacks that took place between 1975-2018.
The Gloabl Terrorism database (GDS) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2018. The dataset I am using contains aroun 1,90,000 terrorism attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2018 except 1993.
Dataset can also be accessed from https://start.umd.edu/gtd/

A report on Global terrorism attacks analysis through R is added as well.
